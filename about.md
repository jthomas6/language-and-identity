#### The Seminar

How does language help us to map the movement of peoples over time and space? How are African languages defined and created? How is Africanness and Blackness encoded in the Spanish and English languages? This course in sociolinguistics invites a critical evaluation of intersections in language and identity in the African continent and the Diaspora. Focusing on eastern Africa and its connection with the Americas, we draw upon overlapping histories of local peoples, outsiders, missionaries, linguists, and others to understand the power of language in defining and creating experience. We will specifically trace the proto-Bantu origin of Swahili, and succeeding historical and contemporary movements of Swahili from Kenya to Mexico. Reflecting on our own lives, we also look to the formation of new communities and frontiers in language use including migration, language policy, social media, videogames.

*Language and Identity in the African Experience*, Spring 2017, Swarthmore College:

- **Dr. Jamie A. Thomas** is Assistant Professor of Linguistics at Swarthmore College. Her forthcoming ethnography Zombies Speak Swahili is all about the undead, videogames, and why language matters. She teaches sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, and applied linguistics with attention to spoken discourse and visual and textual semiotics.

Students name their own identities.

“As a result of this course, my conception of the African experience has become even more layered and complex. I have realized the loopholes in the historical representation of Africa and it has raised many more questions for me. I have also established that identities are never eternally fixed. In learning about AfroLatinx people, I have come to see identity categories as socioracial constructs.”

“Identity is relational and has always been unbounded. I’m now considering my national identity much more, in the context of my racial and language identities. These are important intersectional factors. Also, the categories I ‘fit’ into in one space might not translate to another space. These categories continue to be contested across space and time. There is so much more resistance and detail in the cultural experience of Africans in the New World that is often overlooked in historical works that focus on European motives.”

“Identity is a sense of self that is comprised of claims to ‘place, space, and culture’. Throughout this course, I’ve come to an understanding that the spaces I inhabit or participate in, do affect the ways that I project my identity. I’m now more willing to question the ways I situate myself in relation to others, and also allow myself to claim certain experiences and subjectivities that I have not before. I’m also now really critical of the use of the word ‘identity’ as a blanket term to encompass multiple and complex concepts that may get flattened in certain contexts. My understandings of the African experience have expanded to not allowing myself to think of any geographically specific people with a monolithic life history.”

“I now reimagine interviewing as a process, one in which it is impossible to remain unbiased. My identity has developed as I understand myself in relation to my peers. In some ways, I have reproduced my identity, but in others I have reconstructed my identity more deliberately in terms of my relation to race and my treatment of language.”

“My identity has gained more communicable meaning and significance over the course of this semester. I have always understood myself as existing in a liminal space identity but have a full/complete one as well. Engaging mostly with the narratives of other threshold people has brought me a long way. To understand that patterns of migration (and abduction) vary and change over time helps us to approach Blackness and Latin America with a dynamic in which we see that communities/families/interactions are often shaped by time and space.”
